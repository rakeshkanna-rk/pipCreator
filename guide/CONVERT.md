### 1. **Overview**
The `convert` command is designed to package your Python project into a distribution file that can be easily shared and installed. During this process, the command allows you to upgrade your project's version by directly replacing the current version with the one you provide. This guide will walk you through converting your project, upgrading its version, and accessing further guidance.

### 2. **Converting a Python Project to a Distribution File**
To convert your Python project into a distribution file, use the `convert` command within your project's directory. This will package your project into a format suitable for distribution, such as a `.tar.gz` or `.whl` file.

**Command:**
```bash
pipc convert
```

**What Happens:**
- The command packages your project into a distribution file.
- Depending on your project configuration (e.g., `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`), the appropriate distribution files will be generated in a `dist` directory.
- These files can be uploaded to a package index like PyPI or shared for installation.

### 3. **Upgrading Your Project Version**
When running the `convert` command, you can also upgrade your project's version. Unlike some tools that suggest a version upgrade, this command directly replaces the version with whatever you provide.

**Version Upgrade:**
- During the conversion process, you'll be prompted to enter a new version number.
- The version number you provide will replace the current version in your project’s configuration files.

**Example:**
```bash
convert
```

**What Happens:**
- After initiating the `convert` command, you might be prompted with:
  ```
  Enter new version number: 
  ```
- Whatever version number you enter will overwrite the current version in the configuration files (e.g., `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`).

### 4. **Analyzing and Setting a Version Number**
Since the command does not suggest a version, you should decide on the version number based on your project changes. Follow the Semantic Versioning format (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) when determining the new version number:
- **MAJOR**: Increases when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR**: Increases when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH**: Increases when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

### 5. **Putting It All Together**
Here’s an example sequence of commands to convert your project, set a new version, and access further guidance:

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to your project directory
cd my_project

# Step 2: Convert the project to a distribution file and set a new version
pipc convert
```

**What Happens:**
The `convert` command provides a straightforward way to package your project and upgrade its version by replacing the current version with the one you provide. Be sure to choose the correct version number to maintain consistency and proper versioning in your project.

Always check the generated distribution files in the `dist` directory and test them to ensure they work as expected before distribution.

### 6. **Converting a Python Project to a Distribution File**

```bash
 PS E:\Project> pipc convert

        PIP CREATOR v0.1.0

Converting files will happen @ E:\Project
Project name: new

√ Folder contains all required files.
√ setup.py found.
Update version number? (y/n) [Y]:  
Current version: 0.1.0    
Enter new version number: 0.1.1
Updated version:  0.1.1

√ setup.py updated.
Are you sure you want to convert to distribution file? (y/n) [Y]:
